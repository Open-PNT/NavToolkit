This optional component will be built if your system has a working development copy of the [GDAL
library](http://www.gdal.org). This package is called `libgdal-dev` on Debian-based Linux distros,
including Ubuntu.

It provides a `SpatialMapDataSource` that works with the [Digital Terrain Elevation Data
(DTED)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTED) and the [Geographic Tagged Image File Format
(GeoTIFF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoTIFF) file formats. DoD affiliates can obtain files in
these formats from the [Army Geospatial Center](https://www.agc.army.mil/What-we-do/AGC-Ordering/).
