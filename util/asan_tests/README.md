This folder contains test programs for triggering address sanitizer errors.

They're heavily inspired by [google's sanitizers wiki](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer), but hand-rewritten because I couldn't find any license/copyright information there.

To run, call `test_asan.py` in the parent folder.
